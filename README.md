# Wave Terminal

[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwavetermdev%2Fwaveterm.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwavetermdev%2Fwaveterm?ref=badge_shield)

Wave is an open-source terminal that can launch graphical widgets, controlled and integrated directly with the CLI. It includes a base terminal, directory browser, file previews (images, media, markdown), a graphical editor (for code/text files), a web browser, and integrated AI chat.

Wave isn't just another terminal emulator; it's a rethink on how terminals are built. For too long there has been a disconnect between the CLI and the web. If you want fast, keyboard-accessible, easy-to-write applications, you use the CLI, but if you want graphical interfaces, native widgets, copy/paste, scrolling, variable font sizes, then you'd have to turn to the web. Wave's goal is to bridge that gap.
