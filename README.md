# Wave Terminal 

A open-source, cross-platform, modern terminal for seamless workflows.

Wave isn't just another terminal emulator; it's a rethink on how terminals are built.  Wave combines command line with the power of the open web to help veteran CLI users and new developers alike.

* Inline renderers to cut down on context switching.  Render code, images, markdown, and CSV files without ever leaving the terminal.
* Persistent sessions that can restore state across network disconnections and reboots
* Searchable contextual command history across all remote sessions (saved locally)
* Workspaces, tabs, and command blocks to keep you organized

## Installation

Wave Terminal works with MacOS and Linux (preliminary).

Install Wave Terminal from: [www.commandline.dev/download](https://www.commandline.dev/download)
