# Welcome to Wave Terminal

Wave is an [open-source](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm) terminal that adds the ability to launch graphical widgets, controlled and integrated directly with the CLI. We support MacOS, Linux, and Windows ([Downloads](https://waveterm.dev/download)).

**These docs are incomplete**, but we're working on them. If you have a question, please feel free to ask us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/XfvZ334gwU). If you'd like to file a bug/enchancement, please
use [Github Issues](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues). These docs are also open-source and we do accept PRs for docs [here](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/blob/main/docs). You can click the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of the page to get taken directly to the editor page for that document in GitHub.
