## tl;dr

Wave Terminal collects telemetry data to help us track feature use, direct future product efforts, and generate aggregate metrics on Wave's popularity and usage. We do NOT collect personal information (PII), keystrokes, file contents, AI prompts, IP addresses, hostnames, or commands. We attach all information to an anonymous, randomly generated _ClientId_ (UUID). You may opt out of collection at any time.

Here’s a quick summary of what is collected:

- Basic App/System Info – OS, architecture, app version, update settings
- Usage Metrics – App start/shutdown, active minutes, foreground time, tab/block counts/usage
- Feature Interactions – When you create tabs, run commands, change settings, etc.
- Display Info – Monitor resolution, number of displays
- Connection Events – SSH/WSL connection attempts (but NOT hostnames/IPs)
- AI Commands – Only which AI backend is used (e.g., OpenAI, Claude) – no text or prompts sent
- Error Reports – Crash/panic events with minimal debugging info, but no stack traces or detailed errors

Telemetry can be disabled at any time in settings. If not disabled it is sent on startup, on shutdown, and every 4-hours.

## How to Disable Telemetry

If you would like to turn telemetry on or off, the first opportunity is a button on the initial welcome page. After this, it can be turned off by adding `"telemetry:enabled": false` to the `config/settings.json` file. It can alternatively be turned on by adding `"telemetry:enabled": true` to the `config/settings.json` file.

:::tip

You can also change your telemetry setting (true/false) by running the wsh command:

```
wsh setconfig telemetry:enabled=true
```

:::info

This document outlines the new telemetry system as of v0.11.1. The previous telemetry documentation is still relevant and can be found in our [Legacy Telemetry Documentation](./telemetry-old.mdx), but in general, the new telemetry is a superset of the old.

## Sending Telemetry

Provided that telemetry is enabled, it is sent 10 seconds after Waveterm is first booted and then again every 4 hours thereafter. It can also be sent in response to a few special cases listed below. When telemetry is sent, it is grouped into individual days as determined by your time zone. Any data from a previous day is marked as `Uploaded` so it will not need to be sent again.

### Sending Once Telemetry is Enabled

As soon as telemetry is enabled, a telemetry update is sent regardless of how long it has been since the last send. This does not reset the usual timer for telemetry sends.

### Notifying that Telemetry is Disabled

As soon as telemetry is disabled, Waveterm sends a special update that notifies us of this change. See [When Telemetry is Turned Off](#when-telemetry-is-turned-off) for more info. The timer still runs in the background but no data is sent.

### When Waveterm is Closed

Provided that telemetry is enabled, it will be sent when Waveterm is closed.

## Event Types

Below is a list of the event types collected in the new telemetry system. More events are likely to be added in the future.

## When Telemetry is Turned Off

When a user disables telemetry, Waveterm sends a notification that their anonymous _ClientId_ has had its telemetry disabled. This is done with the `wcloud.NoTelemetryInputType` type in the source code. Beyond that, no further information is sent unless telemetry is turned on again. If it is turned on again, the previous 30 days of telemetry will be sent.

---

## A Note on IP Addresses

Telemetry is uploaded via https, which means your IP address is known to the telemetry server. We **do not** store your IP address in our telemetry table and **do not** associate it with your _ClientId_.

---

## Previously Collected Telemetry Data

While we believe the data we collect with telemetry is fairly minimal, we cannot make that decision for every user. If you ever change your mind about what has been collected previously, you may request that your data be deleted by emailing us at [support@waveterm.dev](mailto:support@waveterm.dev). If you do, we will need your _ClientId_ to remove it.

For a summary of the above, you can take a look at our [Privacy Policy](https://www.waveterm.dev/privacy).
