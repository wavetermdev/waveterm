title: Telemetry
---

Wave Terminal collects telemetry data to help us track feature use, direct future product efforts, and generate aggregate metrics on Wave's popularity and usage. We do not collect or store any PII (personal identifiable information) and all metric data is only associated with and aggregated using your randomly generated _ClientId_. You may opt out of collection at any time.

If you would like to turn telemetry on or off, the first opportunity is a button on the initial welcome page. After this, it can be turned off by adding `"telemetry:enabled": false` to the `config/settings.json` file. It can alternatively be turned on by adding `"telemetry:enabled": true` to the `config/settings.json` file.

You can also change your telemetry setting by running the wsh command:

```
wsh setconfig telemetry:enabled=true
```

This document outlines the new telemetry system. The previous telemetry documentation is still relevant and can be found [here](./telemetry-old.mdx).

## Overview

We collect telemetry events and send them to our cloud server every 4 hours, respecting the `telemetry:enabled` flag as before. Each event has a timestamp and various properties that describe user interactions and system state.

## Event Types

Below is a list of the event types collected in the new telemetry system. More events are likely to be added in the future.

| Event Name           | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |

## When Telemetry is Turned Off

When a user disables telemetry, Waveterm sends a notification that their anonymous _ClientId_ has had its telemetry disabled. This is done with the `wcloud.NoTelemetryInputType` type in the source code. Beyond that, no further information is sent unless telemetry is turned on again. If it is turned on again, the previous 30 days of telemetry will be sent.

---

## A Note on IP Addresses

Telemetry is uploaded via https, which means your IP address is known to the telemetry server. We **do not** store your IP address in our telemetry table and **do not** associate it with your _ClientId_.

---

## Previously Collected Telemetry Data

While we believe the data we collect with telemetry is fairly minimal, we cannot make that decision for every user. If you ever change your mind about what has been collected previously, you may request that your data be deleted by emailing us at [support@waveterm.dev](mailto:support@waveterm.dev). If you do, we will need your _ClientId_ to remove it.

## Privacy Policy

For a summary of the above, you can take a look at our [Privacy Policy](https://www.waveterm.dev/privacy).
