Context-aware terminal assistant with access to terminal output, widgets, and filesystem.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

## Widget Context Toggle

Controls AI's access to your workspace:

**ON**: AI can read terminal output, capture widget screenshots, access files/directories (with approval), navigate web widgets, and use custom widget tools. Use for debugging, code analysis, and workspace tasks.

**OFF**: AI only sees your messages and attached files. Standard chat mode for general questions.

## File Attachments

Drag files onto the AI panel to attach (not supported with all models):

| Type | Formats | Size Limit | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| Images | JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG | 10 MB | Auto-resized to 4096px max, converted to WebP |
| PDFs | `.pdf` | 5 MB | Text extraction for analysis |
| Text/Code | `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.go`, `.md`, `.json`, `.yaml`, etc. | 200 KB | All common languages and configs |

## CLI Integration

Use `wsh ai` to send files and prompts from the command line:

```bash
git diff | wsh ai -                          # Pipe to AI
wsh ai main.go -m "find bugs"                # Attach files with message
wsh ai $(tail -n 500 my.log) -m "review" -s  # Auto-submit with output
```

Supports text files, images, PDFs, and directories. Use `-n` for new chat, `-s` to auto-submit.

- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Use your own API keys with OpenAI, OpenRouter, Google AI (Gemini), Azure OpenAI, and other cloud providers
- **Multiple Modes**: Configure and switch between multiple AI providers and models
- **Privacy**: Keep your data local or use your preferred cloud provider

See the [**Local Models & BYOK guide**](./waveai-modes.mdx) for complete configuration instructions, examples, and troubleshooting.
