- **Smart Context Switching** - Enable Wave AI to see into your widgets and file system
- **Built-in Tools:**
  - Web search capabilities
  - Local file and directory operations
  - Widget screenshots
  - Terminal scrollback access
  - Web navigation

Wave AI is in active beta with included AI credits while we refine the experience. BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) will be available once we've stabilized core features and gathered feedback on what works best. Share your feedback in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XfvZ334gwU).

For more information and upcoming features, visit our [Wave AI documentation](https://docs.waveterm.dev/waveai).

**Other Improvements:**

The headline feature is our files/preview widget now supports browsing S3 buckets. We read credential information directly from your ~/.aws/config, and you can now easily select any of your AWS profiles in our connections drop down to start viewing S3 files. We even support editing S3 text files using our built-in editor.

### v0.11.0 &mdash; Jan 24, 2025

Wave Terminal v0.11.0 includes a major rewrite of our connections infrastructure, with changes to both our backend and remote file protocol systems, alongside numerous features, bug fixes, and stability improvements.

A key addition in this release is the new shell initialization system, which enables customization of your shell environment across local and remote connections. You can now configure environment variables and shell-specific init scripts on both a per-block and per-connection basis.

For day-to-day use, we've added search functionality across both terminal and web blocks, along with a terminal multi-input feature for simultaneous input to all terminals within a tab. We've also added support for Google Gemini to Wave AI, expanding our suite of AI integrations.

Behind the scenes, we've redesigned our remote file protocol, laying the groundwork for upcoming S3 (and S3-compatible system) support in our preview widget. This architectural change sets the stage for adding more file backends in the future.

**Major New Release of Wave Terminal**

The new build is a fresh start, and a clean break from the current version. As such, your history, settings, and configuration will not be carried over. If you'd like to continue to run the legacy version, you will need to download it separately.

Release Artificats and source code diffs can be found on (Github)[https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm].
