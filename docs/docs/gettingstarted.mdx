## Core Concepts

### Tabs and Blocks

- **Tabs**: Like browser tabs, these help organize your work. Create new tabs with <Kbd k="Cmd:t"/>.
- **Blocks**: The building blocks of Wave. Each block can be a terminal, web browser, file preview, AI chat, or other widget.
- **Layout**: Blocks can be dragged, dropped, and resized to create your ideal layout.

### Key Features

1. **Terminal Features**

   - Works with common shells (bash, zsh, fish)
   - Supports standard terminal features (readline, control sequences, etc)
   - Includes the `wsh` command for interacting with Wave's GUI features
   - GPU accelerated (on most platforms)

2. **Graphical Widgets**

   - Preview files (images, video, markdown, code with syntax highlighting)
   - Browse web pages
   - Ask questions and get AI help directly from the terminal (set up multiple AI models)
   - Basic system monitoring graphs

3. **Remote Connections**
   - Easy SSH connections with the connection button <i className="fa-sharp fa-laptop"/>
   - WSL integration on Windows
   - Consistent experience across local and remote sessions

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Open Your First New Tab**

   - New Wave tabs start with a single terminal block
   - Use it just like your regular terminal
   - Create additional terminal blocks with <Kbd k="Cmd:n"/>

2. **Try Some Basic Commands**

   ```bash
   # View a file or directory
   wsh view ~/Documents

   # Open a webpage
   wsh web open github.com

   # Get AI assistance
   wsh ai "how do I find large files in my current directory?"
   ```

3. **Customize Your Layout**

   - Drag block headers to rearrange them
   - Hover between blocks to resize them
   - Right-click tab headers for background options
   - Right-click block headers for block-specific options

4. **Connect to Remote Machines**
   - Click the <i className="fa-sharp fa-laptop"/> button
   - Enter `username@hostname` for SSH connections
   - Or select a WSL distribution on Windows
