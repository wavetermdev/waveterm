### Development Environment

To build and run Wave locally, see instructions at [Building Wave Terminal](./BUILD.md).

### UI Component Library

We are working to document all our UI components in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs) for easy reference and testing. If you would like to help us with this, we would be very grateful!

Our Storybook site is hosted [docs.waveterm.dev/storybook](https://docs.waveterm.dev/storybook).

### Create a Pull Request

Guidelines:

- Before writing any code, please look through existing PRs or issues to make sure nobody is already working on the same thing.
- Develop features on a branch - do not work on the main branch
- For anything but minor fixes, please submit tests and documentation
- Please reference the issue in the pull request

## Project Structure

The project is broken into four main components: frontend, emain, wavesrv, and wsh. This section is a work-in-progress as our codebase is constantly changing.

### Frontend

Our frontend can be found in the [`/frontend`](./frontend/) directory. It is written in React Typescript. The main entrypoint is [`wave.ts`](./frontend/wave.ts) and the root for the React VDOM is [`app.tsx`](./frontend/app/app.tsx). If you are using `task dev` to run your dev instance of the app, the frontend will be loaded using Vite, which allows for Hot Module Reloading. This should work for most styling and simple component changes, but anything that affects the state of the app (the Jotai or layout code, for instance) may put the frontend into a bad state. If this happens, you can force reload the frontend using `Cmd:Shift:R` or `Ctrl:Shift:R`.

We also have a Storybook project configured for testing our component library. We're still working to fill out the test cases for this, but it is useful for testing components in isolation. You can run this using `task storybook`.

### emain

emain can be found at [`/emain`](./emain/). It is the main NodeJS process and is first thing that is run when you start up the app and it forks off the process for the wavesrv backend and manages all the Electron interfaces, such as window and view management, context menus, and native UI calls. Its main entrypoint is [`emain.ts`](./emain/emain.ts). This process does not hot-reload, you will need to manually kill the dev instance and rerun it to apply changes.

The frontend and emain communicate using the [Electron IPC mechanism](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/ipc). All exposed functions between the two are defined twice, once in [`preload.ts`](./emain/preload.ts) and once in [`custom.d.ts`](./frontend/types/custom.d.ts). On the frontend, you call the exposed function by calling `getApi().<function>()`.

### wavesrv

wavesrv can be found at [`/cmd/server`](./cmd/server), with most business logic located in [`/pkg`](./pkg/). It is the primary Go backend for our app and manages the database and all communications with remote hosts. Its main entrypoint is [`main-server.go`](./cmd/server/main-server.go). This process does not hot-reload, you will need to manually kill the dev instance and rerun it to apply changes.

Communication between the wavesrv and the frontend and emain is handled by both HTTP services (found at [`/pkg/service`](./pkg/service/)) and wshrpc via WebSocket (found at [`/pkg/wshrpc`](./pkg/wshrpc/)).

### wsh

wsh can be found at [`/cmd/wsh`](./cmd/wsh/). It serves two purposes: it functions as a CLI tool for controlling Wave from the command line and it functions as a server on remote machines to facilitate multiplexing terminal sessions over a single connection and streaming files between the remote host and the local host. This process does not hot-reload, you will need to manually kill the dev instance and rerun it to apply changes.

Communication between wavesrv and wsh is handled by wshrpc via either forwarded domain socket or WebSocket, depending on what the remote host supports.
